# buttons-practice-project
This is a practice project I'm working on in which I try to recreate the appearance of various popular buttons. The "SUBCRIBE," "JOIN," and "Tweet"
buttons aren't intended to link anywhere; they're just supposed to mimic the appearance of existing buttons and react accordingly when hovered over.
